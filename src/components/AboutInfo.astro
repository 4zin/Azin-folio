    Hello! I’m Camilo Rodelo (many know me as Azin). I believe that developers
    are artists — I combine creativity and code to build meaningful web
    experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into web development began at the Full-Stack Bootcamp at Henry,
    where I worked with <span
      >React, Redux Toolkit, Zustand and Tailwind CSS on the front-end, while
      also exploring Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL on the back-end</span
    >. Over time, I gravitated toward front-end development and UX/UI design,
    mastering TypeScript and Next.js to craft interfaces that are both
    expressive and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the code, my work is driven by a commitment to user experience: clean
    architecture, responsive design, and interfaces that feel intuitive and
    alive. Whether building a <span
      >WordPress site with Elementor, creating a custom Shopify theme with
      Liquid, or launching a React/Next.js project, I focus on delivering
      quality, performance and a polished user journey.</span
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m always learning new technologies and exploring how design, performance
    and accessibility intersect. If you’re looking for a web developer who
    brings both technical depth and design sensibility, you’ve come to the right
    place.
  </p>
